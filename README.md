# Saleae RFFE v2.0 Analyzer

Saleae Analyzer for the MIPI RFFE v2.0 interface.

See www.mipi.org for details on RFFE.
See www.saleae.com for details on the Saleae logic analyzer.

See the Saleae reference Analyzer for details on how to build and update
your own Analyzer plugin.  For possibly out of date details on how to build
the RFFE Analyzer, see the copy of the Saleae instructions below.

## Prerequisites

### Windows

Dependencies:

- Visual Studio 2017 (or newer) with C++
- CMake 3.13+

**Visual Studio 2017**

_Note - newer versions of Visual Studio should be fine._

Setup options:

- Programming Languages > Visual C++ > select all sub-components.

Note - if CMake has any problems with the MSVC compiler, it's likely a component is missing.

**CMake**

Download and install the latest CMake release here.
https://cmake.org/download/

### MacOS

Dependencies:

- XCode with command line tools
- CMake 3.13+

Installing command line tools after XCode is installed:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Then open XCode, open Preferences from the main menu, go to locations, and select the only option under 'Command line tools'.

Installing CMake on MacOS:

1. Download the binary distribution for MacOS, `cmake-*-Darwin-x86_64.dmg`
2. Install the usual way by dragging into applications.
3. Open a terminal and run the following:

```
/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install
```

_Note: Errors may occur if older versions of CMake are installed._

### Linux

Dependencies:

- CMake 3.13+
- gcc 5+

Misc dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Building your Analyzer

### Windows

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -A x64
cmake --build .
:: built analyzer will be located at SampleAnalyzer\build\Analyzers\Debug\SimpleSerialAnalyzer.dll
```

### MacOS

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
# built analyzer will be located at SampleAnalyzer/build/Analyzers/libSimpleSerialAnalyzer.so
```

### Linux

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
